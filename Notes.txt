now i have finished and all is working, no more problems

next steps are:
	1. adding git to project
	2. adding authorization and authentication (bit of change in architecture), 
	3. using migrations (bit of change in architecture maybe),
	4. revisitng frontend + making visual changes
	5. connecting to frontend [adding frontend rendering Fetch()] (making changes in frontend + backend)
	6. final touches to frontend
	7. final touches to backend

sehr gut
